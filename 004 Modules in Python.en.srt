00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,170
Hello and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,050
And in this lecture we're going to talk something about modules that you so you might have heard the

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,720
concept about model of programming and more you know programming essentially means writing programs

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,510
into different chunks where each is actually called as a model.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,010
Now if you take kids and the innocent off Mondial and programming model is actually a piece of code

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,850
which is written by other people or Also it might be written by you.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,580
But the thing is that there are actually a bunch of Python modules available on the internet which are

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:39,150
written by different programmers and what to do is essentially is it is a set of code which is written

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,820
by them and you could go ahead and use that code in your program to do a particular task.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,000
Also there are a bunch of modules which are built in Python which are developed by Python itself which

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,840
provide you with a bunch of functionality to perform different things.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,800
So in this lecture you are going to learn how to actually use modules which are actually built in Python.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,780
So we are going to take simple example of a random module.

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,460
The model would just call as random and we are going to use a function which is called as random and

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,470
to actually make a word or dice in Python.

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,920
So now let's go ahead how to use modules in our programs.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,510
The very first thing which you need to do is that you actually need to import the module which you want

18
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,400
to use.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,580
So as in this case if you want to use the random more do you type in import random.

20
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,110
This essentially does as that tells Python that we actually want to use the danda more deal in our code.

21
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,260
So it is going to be important and a model for us so that we could use those functions which are present

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,800
in the on the model.

23
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,610
So once you have this now let's sort of go ahead and write the code to actually create a what's your

24
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,040
advice.

25
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,420
So essentially what we are going to do here is that we are going to print out 5 to 6 random values by

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,250
using the different function which is present in the random model.

27
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:11,080
So I'm going to dive in for x as a for loop and then I'm going to dive in range and I'm going to specify

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,130
the range value to be 5 as you only want five things here.

29
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,090
And now let's go ahead and use the random function from the random more do you.

30
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,270
So whenever you want to access any function from Mordieu the first thing which you do is that you type

31
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,760
in the more do you will name which is random in this case so I'm going to type in random give a dot

32
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,920
operator and then as you could see there are a bunch of functions from the random module which you could

33
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,540
use.

34
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,440
But in this case if you want a function with just called Last around and which is going to return a

35
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,380
random integer value to us.

36
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,560
So this function actually acts stupid army does or does nothing but the range which is going to be let's

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,850
say 1 to 6.

38
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,050
And as this function returns some value as I said we need to store that particular value.

39
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,590
So let's say we create a new radio bill which is called Life as a result.

40
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,670
So I'm going to simply type in the result over here.

41
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,800
So I type result equals random dot random and I'm going to pass two values here.

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,750
So once I pass these two values to the function it is going to return as a result.

43
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,260
Now the only thing which we need to do is that we need to print out the result.

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:28,330
So I simply type out the end result and we are going to get 5 to 6 random values on this for loop right

45
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:28,660
here.

46
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:36,220
So if I see the code and if I executed as you could see we got some random values that is we got five

47
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,200
random values because we have specified the range as 5.

48
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,740
So you don't need to actually pay attention to the for loop or anything in this lecture.

49
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,510
But the only thing which you need to understand is that how to use modules.

50
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,910
So basically you use modules by importing them.

51
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,090
So you type import and the name of the model which you want to import.

52
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,720
Then once you have the more do you then in order to access a particular function in that more you type

53
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,810
the more you Leam give a dot operator and then type in the function name right after it.

54
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,960
So that basically allows you to use any function in any model which you have imported.

55
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,790
So that's it for this lecture and I hope you guys understood how to actually import it in more detail

56
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,730
and how to actually access any functions within that Marty.

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,860
So thank you very much for watching this lecture and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.

58
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,510
Thank you.
